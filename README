AI Budget Manager Agent

This project is a Streamlit web application that serves as a front-end for an AI-powered budget management agent. The agent analyzes a user's financial data—income, expenses, goals, and spending history—to generate a comprehensive "Budget Health Report" with data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.




Features

•
Intuitive User Interface: A clean, section-based UI built with Streamlit for easy data entry.

•
Multiple Data Inputs: Separate, clearly defined input areas for income, expenses, and financial goals.

•
CSV Upload: Users can upload their transaction history via a CSV file for quick and easy analysis.

•
AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages a powerful AI agent to parse natural language, categorize transactions, and generate a personalized budget.

•
Comprehensive Reporting: Generates a structured "Budget Health Report" in Markdown, including a budget overview, spending analysis, key insights, and goal progress.

•
Secure and Private: The agent is designed with strict constraints to ensure it does not handle real assets, provide financial advice, or store personally identifiable information (PII).
